Waking up early I thought I'd write an inaugural blog post. I don't know if I have goals for this blog; whether it will be more of a public diary, scientific musings, or planting potential seeds for discussion or more serious articles, but it seems like a good oppoturnity to get some thoughts down on paper (or markdown) before they escape into the ether.

One thought, or constellation of thoughts, that's been bouncing around my head for a while has related to biological complexity. I know that's a pretty big topic, but I'm thinking more specifically how complexity in human-made objects or machines differs from naturally evolved objects or machines. Humans make things modularly so that if individual parts break down they can be easily replaced. Most processes or calculations take place within a module, and a clean output is passed to the next module. Each module has a specific input, output, and the "function" of that module is defined by those inputs and outputs. Gasoline is taken from the tank to the cylinders by the fuel pump, liquid gasoline vaporized and passed to the cylinders by the fuel injector, battery and spark plugs turn chemical into electricity, cylinders compress, etc. etc. (sorry I'm pushing the limits of my understanding of an internal combustion engine). All work in concert but, if one breaks down the broken car can be taken to the shop and replaced. At certain scales, biology is similar; certain proteins have specific inputs and outputs, certain organelles have specific inputs and outputs, cells, organs, organisms, etc. However, it's very rarely 1:1. Genetic sequences can code for multiple transcripts, proteins can catalyze multiple reactions and interact with eachother, cells have many inputs and outputs, such the idea of a component's "function" becomes murky. This is incredibly useful in biology, because if one piece breaks (gene is mutated, cell is infected, organ fails) there is no mechanic that can bring a dead organism into the shop and give a tune-up. This results in tons of redundancy, weird complex loops and networks, and things that look nothing like human-built machines.

I know this topic is well tread, but one interesting place where I encountered it was the book "A Mote in God's Eye" by Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven. I don't want to sing too many praises; I think there's one female character, and the first scene she's introduced she reflects on how she's going to marry the young dashing officer main character. It's largely a space adventure for adolescent boys, but it had an interesting perspective on alien technology. Without spoiling too much, when the first time humans board an alien craft they're perplexed at how it operates. It seems like there is no one navigation system, no one oxygen system, etc. (appologies again, my knowledge of space craft is worse than cars). This later relates to the social organization of the species in interesting ways if memory serves me, but I'll leave you to read about that. Point being that perhaps there is something about the architecture of the human mind, its ability (or "function") to place things into discrete categories, assign words to them to communicate about them, that limits our ability to study biology.

This connects with trends I've obseerved in the field of quantitative genetics. From the few years I've been studying it, the history of GWAS seems to have been "we'll study a few thousand people and find the genes for X," and when that didn't account for much heritability it became "we'll study a few more thousand people and find the genes for X," etc. etc. until we get to the omnigenic model and "every gene accounts for some amount of heritability for X" (to grossly simplify and exaggerate). That's all to say that what we see in many of these phenotypes is that, depending on the architecture of the trait, there are tens-to-hundreds-to-thousands of loci required to account for even a fraction of the trait heritability, and it's not even clear what's meant by "loci." Is it more than one gene? Is it more than one variant? Not to even address issues of epistasis, GxE, and pleiotropy. There are some clean cases, one variant leads to a clear molecular change with a clear downstream effect, and many of these provide interesting biological insights and possibie drug targets, but it amazes me how *badly* we underestimated things. I think this all relates back to these issues of man-made vs. naturally evolved system. And while this is all probably understood, it makes me wonder if our approaches on a fundamental level are insufficient.

I know there is a field of complexity science. I've tried to crack it in my free time but never made it very far; it was never clear to me if I need to study dynamical systems or network theory first, or read theoretical or empirical papers, or maybe I'm on the right track and you have to just slowly absorb many facets at once. But I'm also a member of a more "traditional" genetics department, and many of the papers and talks I encounter are meticulous studies of the role of one gene or process. The study roadmap I understand is essentially: someone observes an interesting biological outcome, maybe knockout of a gene has an unintended consequence, so they mess with it in some different context and see what happens, maybe in cells first, then mice. Maybe they measure this or that phenotype depending on the interests of the lab. Oh but in the literature they show this gene has another role. Oh but is it horizontal vs. vertical pleiotropy, do the pathways overlap, etc. etc. All very good work, all interesting, but to someone that mostly debugs R all day it becomes a soup of "every gene does everything" in my mind. I hope this is not at all taken as disparaging, it reflects my own biases and ignorances more than anything, but when a big paper comes out to say "wow this gene does something we never expected" my first response is generally "well yeah."

To connect this to one more idea, there is some degree of bias in the genes that have been historically identified. Because of the limitations and tools of the time, it is somewhat "odd" genes that are discovered first. Maybe they have a large effect, maybe they are particularly pleiotropic, maybe they are GXG or GXE. Whatever the case, there's a reason they pop out first when we do our first scan of the forest, they're the tallest tree. I think there's some danger, though, when we generalize the specific qualities of that gene to others like it, or its function or effect more broadly. When a new gene or function is discovered people run out using the same tools to discover more. Often, seemingly, coming up short. The genes and functions we've discovered did so because they're the tallest trees in the forest. Knowledge we gain from the genes, while vitally improtant, can't be generalized to the rest of the system. Knocking the out in mice might make decent models of certain human diseases, and you might be able to study lots of extremely interesting molecular biology and disease progression, but in some important ways they're fundamentally different from how traits or diseases manifest in nature. It's not as modular as we'd expect from a designed system because it wasn't designed. Essentially, 

Reading back over, this is essentially an ad for "systems biology," but I'm not even quite sure if that's true. Can the natural world be mapped to a finite set of symbols? Or even the human mind? Does it need to for us to influence the world in important ways? Should I re-read "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach?" I'll just leave all of that out there. Hopefully now that I've gotten the thoughts onto paper (or markdown), and now that my alarm went off, I can try to get more sleep. I may do some editing, some corrections, but probably not too many, so apologies for any mistakes or mispellings. I'm trying to work on those "perfectionist" tendencies.

Best,
Derek
