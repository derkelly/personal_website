Welcome! My name is Derek and this is my personal website. I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania in the [Genomics and Computational Biology](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/) program. I'm a member of the [Tishkoff lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/tishkoff/Lab/Tishkoff/Tishkoff.html) interested in human genetic diversity, quantitative genetics, functional genomics, and evolution.
