More insomnia, more complexity. I read an article recently about how medieval peasants used to split sleep into two parts and it's trendy now in some circles. People would pray and write and have sex. I guess I'll be writing.

I woke up from a type of dream I have that is oddly reminiscent of my panic attacks, and my bad acid trip, like it fits into some great destiny I have to discover something important. Some weird Harry Potter parody (not like my acid trip) and then I was walking through a field made of icing while some Beatles song was playing backwards. I guess that isn't so scary. This all relates to life and death somehow, the infinity of sight and sound and taste and smell and feeling, which really can't be infinite because our brain isn't infinite.

I went back and read up on Steppenwolf, where he describes the "suicides." I used to feel like that, and I often do sometimes, but I believe through love and medicine and a commitment to simply enjoying life (looking at you Steppenwolf and Ecclesiastes) I can... simply enjoy life. Another weird loop, eh Hofstadter!

That all relates to my thoughts yesterday and the idea of complexity. To emulate a system, to model it, the modelling system must be more complex than the information contained in the system being emulated, surely. Something something Turing completeness. Something something Godel's incompleteness theorem. Maybe this can't be described in words for the very reasons I'm hinting at, but can't say. Maybe life can't be emulated because there's no machine powerful enough. Maybe I just don't understand these things and that makes them scary and upsetting. No sense being afraid of something you don't understand, and if you do understand it... I don't know, is that still scarier?

Of course, the human brain can't understand or experience anything more complex than itself, so we're all trapped at this level. But surely it can still be enjoyable. "An animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to escape. What will you do?" Is killing ones self the more painful act? To not experience all of ones hopes and dreams. Or is it to continue living? Perhaps that depends on whether it's a life of joy or pain. Perhaps we're all God, telling eachother to keep living through love. Are we caught in a trap? Is the limited life the trap? Is the only escape death? But why escape, what makes it a trap, because it's painful? But it's also beautiful, don't think of it as a trap. We're caught in a loop with both beauty and pain. 

Now that I've overwhelmed myself with more thoughts to upset the mind, I ought to be getting some sleep.
